Hi there, I'm Durgesh Samariya 👋
I am a third year Machine Learning Ph.D. candidate at Federation University, Australia. Apart from that I am seasonal ML developer that loves writing articles (on Machine Learning, Data Science, Productivity and PhD Tips) and contributing to open source.

💻 Currently working on PyML, a python toolkit for building some of machine learning models and state-of-the-art algorithms without using any libraries. The aim of this project is to learn machine learning algorithms from scratch.
👨🏽‍💻 Currently growing my skillset in Machine Learning and Data Science.
My Reseach Interest:

Classification
Clustering
Anomaly Detection
Similarity Measure
I am open to:

any collobration work,
machine learning projects(development or research),
research internships and
available to become reviewer or PC member for Machine Learning/Data mining journals or conferences.
